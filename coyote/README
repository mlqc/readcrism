This directory contains IDL example programs that,
for the most part, were written by programmers
at Fanning Software Consulting. You are free to
use and distribute these programs as you see fit.
We ask that you leave the program documentation
headers, including the AUTHOR headers, in the programs.

The programs are offered "as is", with no guarantee
as to their reliability or fitness for your particular
application.

If you prefer to download all the programs at once,
you may download the file "coyoteprograms.zip".

We hope these programs encourage you to write
even better IDL programs of your own. Please let
us know if you find them useful to you.
