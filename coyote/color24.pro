; NAME:
;       COLOR24
;
; PURPOSE:
;
;       The purpose of this function is to convert a RGB color triple
;       into the equivalent 24-bit long integer. The 24-bit integer
;       can be decomposed into the appropriate color by interpreting
;       the lowest 8 bits as red, the middle 8 bits as green, and the
;       highest 8 bits as blue.

; INPUTS:
;
;       RGB_TRIPLE: A three-element column or row array representing
;       a color triple. Or an N-by-three element array of color triples.

; EXAMPLE:

;       To convert the color triple for the color YELLOW,

;       or the decimal number 65535, type:
;
;       color = COLOR24([255, 255, 0])
;
;       This routine was written to be used with device-independent
;       color programs like GETCOLOR.

FUNCTION COLOR24, color

   ; This FUNCTION accepts a [red, green, blue] triple that
   ; describes a particular color and returns a 24-bit long
   ; integer that is equivalent to (can be decomposed into)
   ; that color. The triple can be either a row or column
   ; vector of 3 elements or it can be an N-by-3 array of
   ; color triples.
